# Setup MetaMask

Here you will find an in-depth how-to guide on installing and setting up the MetaMask wallet. If you only need to add the Optimism Ethereum networks, skip to the end.

#### Step 1. Install the MetaMask browser extension <a href="#step-1-install-the-metamask-browser-extension" id="step-1-install-the-metamask-browser-extension"></a>

To create a new wallet, you have to install the extension first. Depending on your browser, there are different marketplaces to find it.&#x20;

We recommend you download the [MetaMask extension](https://metamask.io/) that matches your browser from their [website](https://metamask.io/) or alternatively your browsers official store.

A word of **caution**, be sure that you are downloading the extension from your browser’s official store or the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) official website. We advise **against downloading** and installing software from third-party sites.

In the Chrome Web Store:

Click **Add to Chrome**

Click **Add Extension**.

### **Step 2. Create a MetaMask account** <a href="#step-2-create-a-metamask-account" id="step-2-create-a-metamask-account"></a>

Once MetaMask is successfully added to your browser, you will be redirected to a setup wizard, which will guide you through the process of creating an account.

Click the **‘Get Started’** button.

![Screenshot of metamask welcome screen](https://cryptodefinitions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Get-Started-e1597515993445.png)

You will be prompted to create a new password. Enter a secure password, agree to the Terms of Use, and click **‘Create.’**

Once you create your password, you will see the screen below. Reveal your **secret back up phrase** and write it on a piece of **paper**.

Please do not take a screenshot or store it on any electronic device. You will need this seed phrase to restore your wallet to a new device. If anyone gets this seed phrase, they can steal all of your funds.

Once you have recorded your secret phrase, click **‘Next’** and go through the confirmation by re-entering the phrase in the correct order.

### **Step 3. Enjoy your new MetaMask installation!** <a href="#step-3-enjoy-your-new-metamask-installation" id="step-3-enjoy-your-new-metamask-installation"></a>

### Adding Optimistic Ethereum to MetaMask: <a href="#adding-optimistic-ethereum-to-metamask" id="adding-optimistic-ethereum-to-metamask"></a>

There are a few easy ways to connect to Optimistic Ethereum to MetaMask. The easiest way is to use these chainid.links. For these links to work, you must access them from a browser with a web3 wallet extension installed (MetaMask, etc.) If you want to only test Kwenta on the Optimistic Goerli testnet, you only need the first network from the list below.

* [Click here to connect to optimistic-goerli](https://chainid.link/?network=optimism-goerli) <-**Testnet**
* [Click here to connect to optimistic-ethereum](https://chainid.link/?network=optimism) <- Mainnet

Alternatively, if you must add the network manually, you can find easy-to-follow instructions [here](https://community.optimism.io/docs/guides/wallet-dev/).
